## Introduction

Welcome to the Face Recognition and Attendance Project repository! This project aims to provide a solution for automating attendance tracking in various settings, such as classrooms, offices, and events, using facial recognition technology.

Attendance tracking is a common task that can be time-consuming when done manually. With the help of facial recognition, this project offers a more efficient and accurate way to record attendance. The system can identify individuals by analyzing their facial features and match them against a pre-defined database, thus streamlining the attendance-taking process.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- React.js (for the web interface)

## execution

- Python 3.11
